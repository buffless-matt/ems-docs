# Public IRC bridges

Matrix.org (and others) host a number of IRC bridges for public networks.

A list of these networks can be found on the [offical documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/bridged_networks.html).

*Please note that matrix.org does not operate all of the networks listed, and is not responsible for content sent over the bridges*.
