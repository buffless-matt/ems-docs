## Linter

[markdownlint](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) is used to ensure consistent Markdown formatting across all documents.

You can run the checks locally by installing `markdownlint-cli` and running `make lint`.

Alternately, run the tests manually:

```bash
markdownlint '**/*.md' --config ./lint/config/default.yml --ignore ./src/SUMMARY.md
markdownlint 'src/SUMMARY.md' --config ./lint/config/summary.yml
```

The rules are defined in `lint/config/default.yml` and `lint/config/summary.yml`. Summary has `MD025` and `MD041` turned off due to how `mdbook` expects the file `SUMMARY.md`.

You can attempt to automatically fix any lint errors by running `make fix` or `markdownlint '**/*.md' --config ./lint/config/default.yml --ignore ./src/SUMMARY.md --fix`.

Extended rule descriptions, including how to fix any formatting errors, are available [here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md).
